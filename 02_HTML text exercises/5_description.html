    <u>Harry Potter</u>'s life is <b><i>miserable</i></b>. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to
    live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth
    about himself: he's a wizard. A <b><i>mysterious</i></b> visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home,
    <u>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</u>.

    After a lifetime of bottling up his <b><i>magical</i></b> powers, <u>Harry</u> finally feels like a <b><i>normal</i></b> kid. But even within the
    Wizarding community, he is <b><i>special</i></b>. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse
    inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a <b><i>brutal</i></b> takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after
    failing to kill Harry.

    Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is <b><i>perfect</i></b>. There is a <b><i>dangerous</i></b>
    secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling
    into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more <b><i>terrifying</i></b> than he ever could have
    imagined.

    Full of <b><i>sympathetic</i></b> characters, wildly <b><i>imaginative</i></b> situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment
    in the series assembles an <b><i>unforgettable magical</i></b>  world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.
